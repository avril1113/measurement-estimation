# Measurement Estimator

Description
--------
State estimation is the method of finding a mobile robotâ€™s position and orientation in an environment. Mobile robots rely on sensors to determine their states. However, sensors are often impeded by noise.

This project built a Mixture Density Network to estimate robot sensors' measurement probability distribution, using a collection of sensor measurements and the states of the robot and the environment.
